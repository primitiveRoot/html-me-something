        <h1>The Data is In</h1>

        <p>Since January, data collected from large internet service providers and search engines indicates an increased interest in data. "what is data" ranked among the top searches since March of this year, followed by "what is exponential" and "is data a conspiracy".<br>This is a marked change from recent years.
